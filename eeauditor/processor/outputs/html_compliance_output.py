            ElectricEye is a multi-cloud, multi-SaaS Python CLI tool for Asset Management, Security Posture Management & Attack Surface Monitoring that supports 100s of services and evaluations to harden your public cloud & SaaS environments with controls mapped to several dozen control frameworks, standards, laws, and policies. Each Check within ElectricEye evaluates a specific component for a specific service for a specific Cloud Service Provider or SasS Vendor such as ensuring storage for a compute service is encrypted, or if a particular type of logging for a service is enabled. For each of those checks, several controls mapped to NIST CSF V1.1 are provided which are in turn mapped to other major frameworks which can aid in audit readiness or other internal audit or controls management exercises.</br> 
            
            </br>This report is not an attestation, certificate, or fancy plaque you paid for that says "SOC2" on it. For enhanced mapping, each NIST CSF V1.1 Subcategory is mapped to CIS Critical Controls V8 which (unless otherwise noted) provide a bulk of the "back-mapping" to other controls and requirements.</br>

            </br>During the evaluation for {providerAssesed}, ElectricEye generated {countFindings} findings with a passing rate for every single finding is {roundedPercentage} for {countUniqueResourceIds} unique Assets across {countAccountsAssessed} Cloud/SaaS Accounts ({accountSentence}) in {countRegionsAssessed} cloud Regions/Zones/Datacenter locations ({regionSentence}).</br>
            
            </br>Across all of these findings generated by ElectricEye, {countUniqueControls} controls were assessed across all frameworks which covered {countAssetClassesAssesed} distinct Asset Classes comprising of {countAssetServicesAssessed} distinct Asset Services which in turn are comprising of {countAssetComponentsAssessed} Asset Components</br>

            </br> Asset Services: </br>

            </br> Asset Components: </br>
            <ul>{assetComponentSentence}</ul>

            </br>This report provides a per-Control breakdown for each Framework that ElectricEye supports, showing you both how many Findings were passed or failed as well as the total passing score per Framework. Below each set of graphics, a table is provided which includes the specific Control identifiers that were checked for the current evaluation, the control description or control objectives (provided by the owners/authors of the standard or framework itself), as well as aggregated Asset information which includes how many unique Classes, Services, and Components were covered per Control as well as the overall Findings per Control.</br>

            </br>This report can be used as a point-in-time snapshot for control sampling or as a guideline before the start of an engagement for audit readiness, cloud hygeine, or other internal audit or GRC related projects. For controlled sampling and time-series analysis, it is recommended to use another output such as JSON or CSV and storing those data snapshots within a data lake or data warehouse for better aggregation and querying. Each standard, law, or framework contains information about the scope, applicability, formal certification/examination processes, recommendation for use, and information about mapping.</br>

Movement to cloud-based computing, virtualization, mobility, outsourcing, Work-from-Home, and changing attacker tactics prompted the update and supports an enterprise's security as they move to both fully cloud and hybrid environments. The CIS Controls were developed starting in 2008 by an international, grass-roots consortium bringing together companies, government agencies, institutions, and individuals from every part of the ecosystem (cyber analysts, vulnerability-finders, solution providers, users, consultants, policy-makers, executives, academia, auditors, etc.) who banded together to create, adopt, and support the CIS Controls. The expert volunteers who develop the Controls apply their first-hand experience to develop the most effective actions for cyber defense. Prioritization is a key benefit to the CIS Controls. They were designed to help organizations rapidly define the starting point for their defenses, direct their scarce resources on actions with immediate and high-value payoff, and then focus their attention and resources on additional risk issues that are unique to their business or mission.</br>

            The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a framework that provides security controls and best practices for organizations to assess and evaluate the security of cloud service providers (CSPs). The CCM aims to help organizations make informed decisions about the security of their data and systems when adopting cloud services. The CCM covers a broad range of security domains, including governance and risk management, compliance and audit, data security and privacy, human resources, operations management, and incident response. Each domain includes a set of security controls and best practices that organizations can use to evaluate CSPs. The CCM defines control objectives for each security domain, which provide specific outcomes that organizations should strive to achieve. These objectives help guide organizations in assessing the effectiveness and maturity of a CSP's security controls. The security controls within the CCM are organized into control families. Each control family focuses on a specific aspect of security, such as access control, data encryption, vulnerability management, or business continuity. These control families help structure the assessment and evaluation of a CSP's security practices.</br>

The CAIQ is a standardized questionnaire that aligns with the CCM. It consists of a series of Yes/No questions based on the CCM's control objectives and control families. The CAIQ is designed to facilitate the assessment and evaluation of a CSP's security practices by providing a structured and consistent approach. The STAR program provides a publicly accessible registry where CSPs and other companies which are primarily hosted on the public cloud can document their security capabilities, practices, and certifications. CSPs can submit a completed CAIQ to obtain a listing in the STAR registry. The STAR registry enables organizations to access valuable information about a CSP's security posture, certifications, and compliance efforts.</br>

In alignment with section 4.1901 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), FCI is defined as information, not intended for public release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under a contract to develop or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including information provided by the Government to the public (such as that on public websites) or simple transactional information, such as that necessary to process payments. CUI is information the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.</br>
