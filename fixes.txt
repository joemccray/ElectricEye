# Log of debugging steps for converting ElectricEye to a Django app

1.  **Problem:** `pytest` failed with `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package` in `tests/conftest.py`.
    **Fix:** Created `tests/__init__.py` and `tests/helpers/__init__.py` to turn the directories into Python packages.

2.  **Problem:** `pytest` was discovering and running tests from the `eeauditor/tests` directory, which were failing due to import errors.
    **Fix:** Modified `pytest.ini` to add `norecursedirs = eeauditor/tests` to exclude the directory from test discovery.

3.  **Problem:** `pytest` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'check_register'`.
    **Fix:** Changed the import in `eeauditor/eeauditor.py` from `from check_register import CheckRegister` to `from .check_register import CheckRegister`.

4.  **Problem:** `pytest` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cloud_utils'`.
    **Fix:** Changed the import in `eeauditor/eeauditor.py` from `from cloud_utils import CloudConfig` to `from .cloud_utils import CloudConfig`.

5.  **Problem:** `pytest` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'azure'`.
    **Fix:** Installed the `azure-identity` package.

6.  **Problem:** `pytest` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'azure.mgmt'`.
    **Fix:** Will install the `azure-mgmt-resource` package.
